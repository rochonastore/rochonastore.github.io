A village fair is an event of annual gathering. People from all walks of life gather here for enjoyment. It brings a change in their monotonous life. A village fair is very significant and beneficial to the villages for many reasons. It inspire the rural economy.</p>
<p>A village fair is usually held on the bank of a river, a Canal or in the open field under a large ancient tree. The date and time of such a festival are unknown. It is held on the first day of the new year, last day of the year or in the occasion of any national festival.</p>
<p>Men women children come to the village fair in large number to enjoy themselves. Women and children are particularly fond of the village fair. They look forward for arrival of this day with eager expectation.</p>
<p>Fancy goods, sweetmeats, dolls, toys and wooden things are mostly sold in the village fair. Circus parties bring tigers, Horses and monkeys. These trained animals show interesting and fancy feats. Here the village young people show their skills in wrestling. The magicians show magic that makes the villagers spellbound.</p>
<p>The village is fair not free from disadvantages. Proper sanitation is not available here. There are even some gambling parties and gathering of addicts. Occurrences of eve teasing are also common.</p>
<p>Miscreants and misdeeds roam about. In spite of all this defects a village fair is a good form of Recreation to the village people. Undoubtedly it is a great value to an agrarian society like Bangladesh. To the villages are deprived of all modern forms of entertainments such as enjoying a cinema hall or visiting a theme park. So attending or enjoying a village fair gives them immense pleasure and entertainment.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Image by <a href="https://pixabay.com/users/Monoar-2240009/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=1274699">Monoar Rahman Rony</a> from <a href="https://pixabay.com/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=1274699">Pixabay</a><br />
Value of time means evaluation of time properly; in other words, doing the right thing in the right moment. Life is nothing but the sum-total of a number of moments. Every moment is useful to us. No other earthly possession is so valuable as time. Time always marches on. It is restless. Time once gone is gone forever.</p>
<p>Seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years- thus time goes on. Life is short and we all know about it. To make it significant, proper use of time is inevitable. We have to do a great many things during this short time. Art is long but time is short. To make life an art, we have to toil much. We have to evaluate every single moment.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s student is tomorrow&#8217;s leader. Student life is the seedling period of life. So, if they fail to perform their duties, the great task called art will be undone and life will be meaningless.  It has aptly been said that, &#8220;Stitch in time saves nine.&#8221; Students must not put off anything for tomorrow what they can do today. Tomorrow is always uncertain. If Nepoleon could reach the battlefield only five minutes earlier, he must not lost the battle of waterloo. Students must remember it. They also ought to remember the saying, &#8220;As you sow so you reap.&#8221;</p>
<p>To make proper use of time we must follow a routine. We must do the right thing in the right time; neither the right thing in the wrong time nor the wrong thin in the right time. We must lead a routine-bound life.</p>
<p>Wastage of time is self destruction. Those who waste time ca never prosper in life. They rather take part in mischievous activities. Some depend on the charity of others. They cannot think of anything good because &#8220;An idle brain is the workshop of devil.&#8221;</p>
<p>Making right use of the time is the source of all success and happiness in life. He who realizes the value of time does his works in due time. All who became immortal and great in world made the proper use of time. We ought to follow their footprints.</p>

<p>Computer is the most wonderful contribution of science. It is a grand success of modern technology. But it has no ability to do anything by itself. It works on the basis of commands given by the operator. It can solve many Complex problems within a very short time.</p>
<p>Computer was not invented overnight. Charles Babbage is called the father of modern computer who invented the structure of computer for the first time in 1833. By following the structure of computer of Babbage, Hervard University and IBM company combinedly invented the modern electric computer in 1944. After this, it has been rapidly modified and many other types of computers have been invented.</p>
<p>A computer performs three functions. It receives data, processes it and at last emits it. First the details of work is put into the input of the computer. It is called programme. The computer does not work in our language. Programme has to put in its own language. This program is typed and produced in the tele-type unit of the information input. Output prints the results with the help of the printing machine. Its signal goes to the memory and the control unit leads them to arithmetic unit. After finishing its tasks it send them to the result output. Thus result is produced by computer.</p>
<p>Computer is very useful to us. It is used in our daily life for various purposes. Computer has made a great change in education. The students of developed countries use computer to prepare their study materials. The result of various examinations is prepared accurately by computer within a short time. Besides, printing thousands of books within a short time computer contributes a lot to the sphere of education. At present computer is used for diagonising diseases. A new process of operation is invented by computer as an alternative to surgery.At present computer is used to run mills, factories and industries in developed and developing countries. Trains, cars and planes are also run by the computer.</p>
<p>We cannot pass a single moment without computer. It lessens our workload and makes our life easier. But it has not been fully introduced in Bangladesh. So we should use it all over Bangladesh. It can also be used in ill purposes. Prevention of such all motives is also necessary.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Image by <a href="https://pixabay.com/users/madartzgraphics-3575871/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=2070972">Darwin Laganzon</a> from <a href="https://pixabay.com/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=2070972">Pixabay</a><br />
Human life besets of struggle. It has countless difficulties and obstacles. A man having no particular goal, fixed purpose and predetermined aim in life can&#8217;t overcome these problems successfully. His position in the world thus will be meaningless. So thinking over his own capacity, he must choose a career. For this he needs to get prepared.</p>
<p>Choice of career varies from person to person. It depends on man&#8217;s tastes, liking&#8217;s and capacity. Some want to be engineers, some want to be teachers, some want to be doctors and so on.</p>
<p>I am a student and I also have a particular aim in life of my own. I would like to be a doctor. I do know and do believe that serving people is to serve God. I do also believe that money is not enough to make our life meaningful. Mental peace and satisfaction and people&#8217;s respect should be taken into consideration. So I have decided to study medicine and  wished to be a good physician.</p>
<p>The village people are poor. They cannot even meet up their daily necessities. They can&#8217;t even manage two square meals a a day. They do not know they basic rules of sanitation.</p>
<p>I wish to go back to my native village and serve the poor villagers. I shall serve the poor patients by giving them prescription and even medicine free of cost. I shall take fees from the rich. I have a strong desire to set up a charitable dispensary for rendering services to all classes of patients. I think if I can be able to cure my patients, their smile will be my inspiration and only then my profession will be a meaningful one.</p>
<p>I think that I shall be able to reach my goal and serve the nation at the cost of my own happiness, comfort and luxury. Meanwhile, true happiness and comfort lies inward. Consuming expensive things can&#8217;t bring peace. I want to lead a peaceful life. It is my ambition. Great expectations cannot go in vain. I believe I shall be able to avail my expectation. My career will inscribe my name in the heart of the distressed and here lies all my luxury, all my success.</p>

<p>Newspaper is considered as the moving storehouse of knowledge. It bears great importance for the learners-cum knowledge seekers. it is of great importance in modern life. Modern life cannot be thought without  newspaper.</p>
<p>Newspaper was first published in China. The first Bengali newspaper was the &#8216;Samachar Darpan&#8217;. The Missionaries of Sree Rampur published it in 1818. Now we cannot think of modern life without newspaper.</p>
<p>Newspapers are of different kinds. They are the daily, the weekly, the fortnightly, the monthly, the quarterly, the periodical etc. Most people read the dailies, for the give fresh news and views of the day. Others are known as periodicals and magazines. This mostly contains stories, poems, novels and features.</p>
<p>Newspapers  are of great uses to all walks of people. It gives us both pleasure and knowledge. We  get world news, local news, sports news, market news, trade news etc. in a newspaper. It also helps the formation of public opinion. Students can learn many things from reading newspapers. They can add to their knowledge of language, improve their power of thinking and thus can attend the ability of expressing their views on the problems of the day.</p>
<p>The recreational value of a newspaper cannot be ignored in the true sense of the term. When we feel tired or lonely, open take up a paper for relief.</p>

He further said that, a newspaper is more powerful than one hundred bullets. Excepting a few causes of Papparasti and yellow journalism, newspapers are of great value, even in the age of electronic media.</p>
