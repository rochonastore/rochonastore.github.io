								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>A book fair is a display of various type of books kept in different stalls. There are many occasions for which book fair is held time to time. Sometimes it is held to celebrate any historical event. I paid a visit to a book fair on the last February. It was held at Bangla Academy premises on the occasion of the great 21st February. The organizer of the book fair was Bangla Academy. I along with my parents went to the book fair in the morning. I went to the fair in order to by  some books. There I saw my friends and other people. The book fair was in a festive mood. A seminar was held in the book fair. I attended it and listened to the discussion on the history of our mother tongue. Some prominent poets were discussing in the seminar. I enjoyed myself amidst the literary figures of the seminars as I like literary discussion. After attending the seminar, I went to buy books. I bought books on adventure and poems. Then I bought a book written about our liberation war. I bought two novels of Humayun Ahmed. These books were in great demand. I visited different parts of the book fair and saw a good number of book stalls in the fair. In the book fair, I met Anisul Haque who is my favourite writer. I was very happy visiting the book fair. I wish I could visit the book fair every year.</p>

<p>A man who sells things by moving from street to street is a street hawker. He is a self-employed person. He is familiar figure in the cities and towns. He is also seen in the village. He make peculiar sound to draw the attention of is customers. His work is tiresome. He carries his materials on head, sometimes hand, sometimes in a bag and sometimes in small handcart. He generally buys his goods at a cheaper rate and sells them with a good profit. His articles are attractive mainly to women and the children. He usually sells toys, cosmetics, ready-made garments, utensils, sweets, ribbons, fruits etc. He goes door to door with his goods. He tries his best to sell his goods as his livelihood depends on the sale of his goods. Although, he works hard, his life is miserable. Almost all the time he leads inhuman life. sometimes he can&#8217;t keep body and soul together. He has to starve when he cannot sell anything. Sometimes he sells well but sometimes his sale becomes very low. Then his life becomes miserable and hard. A street hawker plays an important role by fulfilling the demand of many significant goods of the people that cannot go out. So, a street hawker is a very important person.</p>

<p>Tree plantation means planting tree more and more planned way. It is now going on a green revolution and has become a social movement. The act of planting trees largely has become a great necessity on earth. We cannot think of our existence without trees. In our daily life, the uses of trees are numerous. In order to live we need oxygen. Tress give us that oxygen. They food and fruits. We get vitamins and minerals from fruits and vegetables. They also give us accommodation. We get timber from trees and without timbers we cannot build our houses, make our furniture, boats, launches etc. If trees are planted on the banks of the rivers and sea-shores, soil erosion can be prevented. Without trees, lands become deserts. Many kinds of medicines are found from leaves, roots, and barks of trees. But our trees and forests are not sufficient in proportion to our total population. Every country should have 25% of forest lands. But we have only 16% of forest lands in our country. So, to preserve our environment, we should plant more and more trees. Government should take necessary steps every year and celebrate tree plantation month to make people interested in planting trees. The non-government organisations should also come forward to plant more trees. For this, they can make people conscious about the necessities of planting more and more trees. For this, they can make people conscious about the necessities of planting mor and more trees in all the fallow lands. Besides government and non-government organizations, different institutions and individuals can take initiative to plant and grow more trees.</p>

<p>Water pollution indicates impuring water in many ways through which water becomes nothing but poison. People pollute water in many ways. They frequently through garbages into water. Toxic chemicals of factories are drained off into rivers and canals. Fertilizers used in cultivation mix with water and thus the water gets seriously polluted. The ultimate outcome of water pollution is suffering from deadly diseases like diarrhoea, dysentry, typhoid, cholera etc. Water-born diseases are not less fatal then the air-born diseases. Water contamination is sometimes beyond treatment. So we should be careful about it. We must be aware of pollution and must not contaminate water. We should drink pure water. We can easily collect rain water for the purpose of drinking since it solely pollution-free. Utensils should be washed with pure, preferably boiled water. The authority concerned should build and run new water treatment plants and sink more tube-wells. Government should make laws and rules regarding water of rivers, canals and ponds as well as rain for our betterment. The persons and factories as well as industries which are responsible for this must be punished. These are the ways by which the water pollution can be brought under control.</p>

<p>National flag is the symbol of Independence and sovereignty of a nation. Every Nation of the world has a national flag of its own. Bangladesh has also a national flag. The national flag of Bangladesh is a pride for us. It is the symbol of our independence, sovereignty and uprightness. Our national flag has a definite size and shape. Portion of its length and breadth is 10:6. Our national flag has a rectangular green background with a round red circle in the middle. The radius of the red circle is one fifth of the length of the flag. The green colour represents the admiration of youthful vigor as well as the Green Fields and the greenery of Bangladesh. The red circle symbolizes the rising sun with new hopes and aspirations of a nation. It also stands for the supreme sacrifice of The Martyrs of the Liberation war. The flag is hoisted everywhere on the top of our important government buildings and educational institutions. It is hoisted everywhere on the Independence Day and the victory day. The national flag is kept half mast in the days of mourning e.g. The Martyrs Day and Jatiyo Shok Dibosh. National flag is very appealing to us as we have achieved it at the cost of 3 million lives. We have great honour and responsibility to the flag. Our national flag always inspires us to dedicate our lives for the greater interest of the country. So we should uphold it&#8217;s prestige by any means.</p>

<p>A very strong dependence on and addiction to drugs is called drug addiction. Drug addiction is a great problem in the modern society. It is a social evil and Vice. Drug addiction is caused by frustration and evil company. Some young people take drug to forget their failures in life. Sometimes Evil company and liking for Evil things lead a man to draw addiction. Furthermore there are some very rich mean who are reckless in life take drug as a means of enjoyment. Taking drug is a kind of luxury to them. A drug addicted man is like a beast. He fails to control himself. He loses his physical as well as mental balance. He losses all the good sides of his character and moral restraint. Drug addiction severely effects one&#8217;s health. It causes untimely and painful death. Drug addiction is not spreading all over the world like a contagious disease. It has become a curse to human civilization. It has become a great social problem in Bangladesh.  Many people including the young, the mineral including east and the old as well as the Teenage have become addicted to drugs in our country. Now our society is Cursed with this destructive trend. But our concerned authority and government should take necessary steps to defeat this giant problem.The export and the import of drugs must be stopped. All kind of sale and buy of drugs must be stopped. Otherwise, the whole society will collapse real soon.</p>
