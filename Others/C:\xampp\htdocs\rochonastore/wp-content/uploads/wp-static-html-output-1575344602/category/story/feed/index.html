<p>Once there lived a good king in Scotland. His name was Robert Bruce. He loved his country and his peoples very dearly. His people had a great love and respect for him. One day his enemies attacked his country and drove him away from his kingdom. He took shelter into a cave. The king was always in a pensive mood for his unhappy condition. Being a king, he showed kingly amenities in his palace. There not the least hope of that luxurious life at his present residence. But that did not cause him much mental suffering. His worst agonies were the facts of being driven out of his beloved kingdom and the suffering of his people by his enemies. In fact, his deep concern for his country and countrymen made him mentally crippled. Defeat after defeat turned him so disheartened that he had not the least hope of regaining his kingdom. In such a mental state, once he was lying in the cave in pensive mood. Suddenly, he saw a spider trying to reach the ceiling of the cave. The spider tried six times and attain success at the seventh attempt. The dauntless effort and success of the spider inspired Robert Bruce to foil despair. He gathered new soldiers, weapons and attacked his enemies with stronger aspiration. The foes courted defeat and Robert Bruce regained his kingdom.</p>

<p>Bayezid was a small boy. His mother was ill. One day he was studying by the side of the bed of his ailing mother. All on a sudden, his mother woke up, raised her head and told her son to give her a glass of water. But there was no water at home. Bayezid went to a distant fountain to fetch water. There was dark outside and was almost midnight. The foxes were howling all around. The fountain was at the end of the village. He went there and took water for his mother in a jar. He then came back home and found his mother asleep. He did not awake her. Keeping a glass of water in his hand, he remained standing still beside his mother&#8217;s bed. He was waiting for his mother&#8217;s awakening. But she was in sound sleep. When it was dawn, Bayezid&#8217;s mother awoke and she instantly found her son standing beside her bed with a glass of water in his hand. She wondered for a moment. Then she could realize the fact. She could not control her tears anyway. She embraced her son with deep love and blessed him from the core of her heart.</p>

<p>Once there lived an honest woodcutter in a village. He used to cut wood in a nearest forest. One day he was cutting wood in that forest near a river. Suddenly, his axe fell in into the river. The river was very deep. The woodcutter did not know how to swim or dive. There was also fear of crocodiles in that river. So, finding no way, he was sitting there and was crying silently. Then a wonderful thing happened. A beautiful fairy appeared before him and asked him why he was crying. The woodcutter told her everything. The fairy thought for a while and went into the river. She came out with an axe made of gold. She asked the woodcutter if it was his axe. The answer from the woodcutter was negative. Then the fairy again went into the river and came again with an axe made of silver. He again asked the woodcutter and the woodcutter again refused to take that axe. The fairy again went into the river and this time she came up with an axe made of iron. Seeing his own axe, the woodcutter became very happy and thanked the fairy. The fairy became pleased with the woodcutter at his honesty and gave him the other two valuable axes as reward. Honesty is thus always rewarded and praised.</p>
