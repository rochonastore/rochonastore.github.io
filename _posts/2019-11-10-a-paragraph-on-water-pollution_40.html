People pollute water in many ways. They frequently throw garbage into water. Toxic chemicals of factories are drained off into rivers and canals. Fertilizers used in cultivation mix with water and thus the water gets seriously polluted. The ultimate outcome of water pollution is suffering from deadly diseases like diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, cholera etc. Water-born diseases are not less fatal then the air-born diseases. Water contamination is sometimes beyond treatment. So we should be careful about it. We must be aware of pollution and must not contaminate water. We should drink pure water. We can easily collect rain water for the purpose of drinking since it solely pollution-free. Utensils should be washed with pure, preferably boiled water. The authority concerned should build and run new water treatment plants and sink more tube-wells. Government should make laws and rules regarding water of rivers, canals and ponds as well as rain for our betterment. The persons and factories as well as industries which are responsible for this must be punished. These are the ways by which the water pollution can be brought under control.</div>
