Air, water, soil etc are elements of environment. Air is polluted by industries and burning wood for cooking. Water is polluted by smoke produced by mills and factories. Sound is polluted by the noise made by vehicles, horns and microphones. There are also other causes of environmental pollution such as cutting down trees, filling up rivers with soil and hunting and killing birds and animals. There are many severe effects of environment pollution. The effects of environment pollution are premature death, spreading of diseases and rising of global temperature. Frequent drought, huge rainfall and frequent floods are also effects of environment pollution. We can keep environment free from pollution by stopping polluting environment and taking steps to keep environment fresh and clean. Both the public and private sectors should work together to prevent environment pollution. The government should take appropriate initiatives to stop pollution. The persons and companies that are responsible for environment pollution should be taken under punishment. Different NGOs can run some awakening programs. Thus environment pollution can be prevented and stopped at the same time and we will get a happy and healthy life.&nbsp;</div></div>
