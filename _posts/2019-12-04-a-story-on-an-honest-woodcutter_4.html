He used to cut wood in a nearest jungle. One day he was cutting wood near a river. Suddenly his axe fell down into the river. The current of the river was very swift. There was also fear of crocodiles too. Even the woodcutter did not know how to swim. So he was crying silently under a tree. Suddenly a wonderful thing happened to him. A fairy appeared upon him and asked him why he was crying. The woodcutter told her everything. The fairy thought for a while and went into the river. She came back with an axe made of gold and asked the woodcutter if it was his axe. The woodcutter replied in the negative. The fairy again went into the river and came back with an axe made of silver. She again asked the same thing to the woodcutter. This time also the reply from the woodcutter was negative. The fairy again went into the river and came back with an axe made of iron. The woodcutter amazed to see his axe and replied in the positive. The fairy amazed to see the honesty of the woodcutter and gave him all the three axes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
