He lived in a city called Bastam in Iran. He used to study late hours at night. One day he was studying in his room. His mother was ill and sleeping by him. Suddenly she woke up and asked for water. Bayazid went out to find water. But there was no water in the house. So he went out in search of water. There was dark outside and almost midnight. There was no one outside that time. There was a little stream at the and of the village. Taking water from that stream he came back home safely. When he entered home, he found his mother sleeping in bed. So he remains standing beside his mother until dawn. In the morning when his mother woke up, his mother found him standing beside him and asked him if he was standing all night standing beside her. The answer from Bayazid was affirmative. Her mother amazed at him and prayed to Allah for Bayazid's blessing.</div>
