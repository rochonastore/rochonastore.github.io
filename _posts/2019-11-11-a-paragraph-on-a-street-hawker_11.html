He is a self-employed person. He is a familiar figure in the cities and towns. He is also seen in the village. He makes peculiar sounds to draw the attention of is customers. His work is tiresome. He carries his materials on his head, sometimes hand, sometimes in a bag and sometimes in a small handcart. He generally buys his goods at a cheaper rate and sells them with a good profit. His articles are attractive mainly to women and children. He usually sells toys, cosmetics, ready-made garments, utensils, sweets, ribbons, fruits etc. He goes door to door with his goods. He tries his best to sell his goods as his livelihood depends on the sale of his goods. Although he works hard, his life is miserable. Almost all the time he leads inhuman life. sometimes he can’t keep body and soul together. He has to starve when he cannot sell anything. Sometimes he sells well but sometimes his sale becomes very low. Then his life becomes miserable and hard. A street hawker plays an important role by fulfilling the demand of many significant goods of the people that cannot go out. So, a street hawker is a very important person.</div>
