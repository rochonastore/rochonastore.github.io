It is of great importance in modern life. Modern life cannot be thought without&nbsp; newspaper.<br /><br />Newspaper was first published in China.&nbsp;The first Bengali newspaper was the ‘Samachar Darpan’. The Missionaries of Sree Rampur&nbsp;published it in 1818. Now we cannot think of modern life without newspaper.<br /><br />Newspapers are of different kinds.&nbsp;They are the daily, the weekly,&nbsp;the&nbsp;fortnightly, the monthly, the quarterly, the periodical etc.&nbsp;Most people read the&nbsp;dailies,&nbsp;for the give fresh news and views of the day. Others are known as periodicals and magazines.&nbsp;This mostly contains stories, poems, novels and features.<br /><br />Newspapers&nbsp; are of great uses to all walks of people. It gives us both pleasure and knowledge. We&nbsp; get world news, local news, sports news, market news, trade news etc. in a newspaper. It also helps the formation of public opinion. Students can learn many things from reading newspapers. They can add to their knowledge of language, improve their power of thinking and thus can attend the ability of expressing their views on the problems of the day.<br /><br />The recreational value of a newspaper cannot be ignored in the true sense of the term.&nbsp;When we feel tired or lonely,&nbsp;open take up a paper for relief.<br /><br />Newspapers are not without flaw. Sometimes they become politically biased&nbsp;and publish sensational news.&nbsp;They thus mislead or people excite public feeling and disturb the peace of the society.&nbsp;Yellow journalism causes irreparable harm to the young generation.<br /><br />To conclude, we should form the habit of reading newspaper everyday. It is must for every school. Napoleon Bonaparte, the great French hero compares newspaper to the fourth state. He further said that, a newspaper is more powerful than one hundred bullets. Excepting a few causes of Parasitism and yellow journalism, newspapers are of great value, even in the age of electronic media.</div>
