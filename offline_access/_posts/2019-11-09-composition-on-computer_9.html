But it has no&nbsp;ability to do anything by itself.&nbsp;It works on the basis of commands given by the operator. It can solve many Complex problems within a very short time.<br /><br />Computer was not invented overnight.&nbsp;Charles Babbage is called the father of modern computer who invented the structure&nbsp;of computer for the first time in 1833. By following the structure of computer of Babbage, Hervard University&nbsp;and&nbsp;IBM company&nbsp;combinedly invented the modern electric computer in 1944. After this,&nbsp;it has been rapidly modified and many other types of computers have been invented.<br /><br />A computer performs three functions.&nbsp;It receives data, processes it and at last emits it. First the details of work is put into the input of the computer.&nbsp;It is called programme. The computer does not&nbsp;work in our language. Programme has to put in its own language. This program is typed and produced in the tele-type unit of the information input. Output prints the results with the help of the printing machine. Its signal goes to the memory and the control unit leads them to arithmetic unit.&nbsp;After finishing its tasks it send them to the result output. Thus result is produced by computer.<br /><br />Computer is very useful to us.&nbsp;It is used in our daily life for various purposes. Computer has made a great change in education. The students of developed countries use computer to prepare their study materials. The result of various examinations is prepared accurately by computer within a short time.&nbsp;Besides, printing thousands of books within a short time computer contributes a lot to the sphere of education. At present computer is used for diagonising diseases. A new process of operation is invented by computer as an alternative to surgery.At present computer is used to run mills, factories and industries in developed and developing countries. Trains, cars and planes are also run by the computer.<br /><br />We cannot pass a single moment without computer.&nbsp;It lessens our workload and makes our life easier. But it has not been fully introduced in Bangladesh.&nbsp;So we should use it all over Bangladesh. It can also be used in ill purposes.&nbsp;Prevention of such all motives is also necessary.</div>
