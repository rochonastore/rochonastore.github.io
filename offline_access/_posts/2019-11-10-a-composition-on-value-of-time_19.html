Life is nothing but the sum-total of a number of moments. Every moment is useful to us. No other earthly possession is so valuable as time. Time always marches on. It is restless. Time once gone is gone forever.<br /><br />Seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years- thus time goes on. Life is short and we all know about it. To make it significant, proper use of time is inevitable. We have to do a great many things during this short time. Art is long but time is short. To make life an art, we have to toil much. We have to evaluate every single moment.<br /><br />Today’s student is tomorrow’s leader. Student life is the seedling period of life. So, if they fail to perform their duties, the great task called art will be undone and life will be meaningless.&nbsp; It has aptly been said that, “Stitch in time saves nine.” Students must not put off anything for tomorrow what they can do today. Tomorrow is always uncertain. If Napoleon could reach the battlefield only five minutes earlier, he must not lost the battle of Waterloo. Students must remember it. They also ought to remember the saying, <b>“As you sow so you reap.”</b><br /><br />To make proper use of time we must follow a routine. We must do the right thing in the right time; neither the right thing in the wrong time nor the wrong thin in the right time. We must lead a routine-bound life.<br /><br />Wastage of time is self destruction. Those who waste time ca never prosper in life. They rather take part in mischievous activities. Some depend on the charity of others. They cannot think of anything good because,&nbsp;<b>“An idle brain is the workshop of devil.”</b><br /><br />Making right use of the time is the source of all success and happiness in life. He who realizes the value of time does his works in due time. All who became immortal and great in world made the proper use of time. We ought to follow their footprints.</div>
