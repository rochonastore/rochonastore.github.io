Because the demand is greater than the supply. No development can be thought of without electricity. Mills and factories, offices and industries even our day to day life will stop if there is no electricity. Electricity is a part and parcel of our life. Bangladesh needs 6000 MW of electricity every day but our production is only 4500 MW of electricity. So, there is a shortage of 1500 MW of electricity. As a result, some areas suffer much from this problem. Especially the rural areas suffer much from this problem. Students cannot study because of load-shedding. They can not prepare lessons and prepare themselves ready for exam so they cut a sorry figure in the exam. Mills and factories can not produce due to a shortage of electricity. As a result, our gross national product is very low. It affects our national economy. More powerhouses should be build up to solve the problem. Damaged powerhouses should be repaired for this purpose. More hydro-electricity projects should be built up to solve the problem. The persons that are responsible for this unfair activity should be given exemplary punishment. The mass media like television, radio, newspaper, can publish necessary information in this respect. Our Govt. should make the people aware about the use of solar electricity and other kinds of power sources. Electricity can also be purchased from neighboring countries. After doing all these things, we can hope to have a comfortable and happy life.<br /><br /><br /></div>
