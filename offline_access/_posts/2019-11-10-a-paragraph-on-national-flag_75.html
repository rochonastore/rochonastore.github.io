It sometimes signifies a country's historical background, culture or even geological condition. Almost 195 countries have their own flag. Bangladesh also has it's national flag. Our national flag reminds us of the nine months long battle which took place in 1971 to get freedom and become a sovereign country.&nbsp;It is actually a great piece of pride for us. Our national flag is of a definite shape and size. The official proportion of it's height and width is 10:6. It is rectangular in shape. The rectangle is green and there is a red circle almost in the middle of the rectangle. The circle has a radius of about one-fifth of the length of the flag. The center of the circle is on the intersecting point of the perpendicular drawn from the nine-twentieth part of the length of the flag and the horizontal line drawn through the middle of its width. The designer of our national flag is Mr Quamrul Hassan. The green and red colour in our flag has its meaning. The green colour mainly represents the green nature of our country. Some people imagine it as it symbolizes the strength of our youth as they were mainly the heroes is the freedom war. The red circle symbolizes the blood of the martyrs. It also symbolizes rising sun of freedom. The national flag of our country is hoisted everyday on the top of every government office and the educational institutions. It is hoisted everywhere on the independence day and victory day. On the days of mourning like martyrs day and Jatiyo Shok Dibosh, the flag is kept half-mast to. Our national flag is sign of pride for us as we achieved it after sacrificing almost 3 million lives. We also have our respect for our national flag. It inspires us all the time to do our duty towards our country and sacrifice our lives for the betterment of our country if needed. We should uphold its dignity at any cost.</div></div>
