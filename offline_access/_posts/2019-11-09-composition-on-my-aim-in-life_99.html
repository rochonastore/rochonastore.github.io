It has countless difficulties and obstacles. A man having no particular goal, fixed purpose and predetermined aim in life can’t overcome these problems successfully. His position in the world thus will be meaningless. So thinking over his own capacity, he must choose a career. For this he needs to get prepared.<br /><br />Choice of career varies from person to person. It depends on man’s tastes, liking’s and capacity. Some want to be engineers, some want to be teachers, some want to be doctors and so on.<br /><br />I am a student and I also have a particular aim in life of my own. I would like to be a doctor. I do know and do believe that serving people is to serve God. I do also believe that money is not enough to make our life meaningful. Mental peace and satisfaction and people’s respect should be taken into consideration. So I have decided to study medicine and&nbsp; wished to be a good physician.<br /><br />The village people are poor. They cannot even meet up their daily necessities. They can’t even manage two square meals a a day. They do not know they basic rules of sanitation.<br /><br />I wish to go back to my native village and serve the poor villagers. I shall serve the poor patients by giving them prescription and even medicine free of cost. I shall take fees from the rich. I have a strong desire to set up a charitable dispensary for rendering services to all classes of patients. I think if I can be able to cure my patients, their smile will be my inspiration and only then my profession will be a meaningful one.<br /><br />I think that I shall be able to reach my goal and serve the nation at the cost of my own happiness, comfort and luxury. Meanwhile, true happiness and comfort lies inward. Consuming expensive things can’t bring peace. I want to lead a peaceful life. It is my ambition. Great expectations cannot go in vain. I believe I shall be able to avail my expectation. My career will inscribe my name in the heart of the distressed and here lies all my luxury, all my success.</div>
