There are many occasions for which book fair is held from time to time. Sometimes it is held to celebrate any historical event. I paid a visit to a book fair on the last February. It was held at Bangla Academy premises on the occasion of the great 21st February. The organizer of the book fair was Bangla Academy. I along with my parents went to the book fair in the morning. I went to the fair to buy some books. There I saw my friends and other people. The book fair was in a festive mood. A seminar was held in the book fair. I attended it and listened to the discussion on the history of our mother tongue. Some prominent poets were discussing in the seminar. I enjoyed myself amidst the literary figures of the seminars as I like literary discussion. After attending the seminar, I went to buy books. I bought books on adventure and poems. Then I bought a book written about our liberation war. I bought two novels by Humayun Ahmed. These books were in great demand. I visited different parts of the book fair and saw a good number of bookstalls in the fair. In the book fair, I met Anisul Haque who is my favourite writer. I was very happy visiting the book fair. I wish I could visit the book fair every year.</div>
