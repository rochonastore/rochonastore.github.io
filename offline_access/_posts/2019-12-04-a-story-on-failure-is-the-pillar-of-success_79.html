He was a good king as he loved his country and his peoples dearly. The people of his country also respected him with honour. One day, the English army attacked his country and drove him away from his kingdom. He tried his best for six times but couldn't get his kingdom back. His army was defeated again and again against king Edward of England. Being defeated six times, he lost all hope. He fled away to save his life and took shelter in a cave. He was always in a pensive mood. Days were passing by and the king was thinking over his misfortune. One day he was lying in a cave in a forest. Suddenly, he noticed a spider which was trying to reach the ceiling of the cave. It fell down again and again but did not give up its attempts. At its seventh attempt, it succeeded in reaching the ceiling of the cave. Seeing this, the king got his hope back. It encouraged the king very much. Gathering his soldiers, he led an expedition against England. He overthrew the English army and at last succeeded to secure the independence of Scotland.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
